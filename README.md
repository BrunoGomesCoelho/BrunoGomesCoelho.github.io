## Credits
The main template was taken from [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) by Michael Rose

During my time personalizing it, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWrcgHwSG8M) came in very handy.

When writing out mathematical formulas using Mathjax, [this stackexchange post](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) was frequently used.

Notes to self:
- Running locally can be a pain. What seems to work for me is just using bundle in root, even though it's not advised, ie:
```config
sudo bundle
sudo bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental
```
- See [here](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/grantmcdermott.github.io) for notes on changing the default page to a more "about me" look.
- Change \_data/navigation.yml to change the top headbar.

## Contributing
General typos and small bug fixes are always very welcome; Other than that, the repository mostly serves for me to organize my website, so there's no need to take open issues, in factly unless it is something very technicall, I would probably prefer if you didn't.
