Very excited to have won first place on Dotz' s first Data Science Competition! 

Alongside my great teammate [Tobias Veiga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobias-veiga-667901152/), we developed the best solution for hierarchical classification of e-commerce products using their textual descriptions.

Always interesting to develop a NLP solution in a language different than English and bridge the gap between state of the art and industry - Our solution was praised not only for the highest metrics achieved but for it's scalability and ease of use.
Our pipeline used a mixture of portuguese Bert, Character CNNs, traditional sparseBOW model and hierarchical specific models.

Shout out to fellow contenders Felipe Maia Polo and Andr√© Sacilotti for their amazing solutions as well, it was a very close competition and I'll be keeping a eye on what they develop in the future. [More info (portuguese)](https://tecno4me.com/dotz-divulga-resultado-do-desafio-hackathon-dotz/)
