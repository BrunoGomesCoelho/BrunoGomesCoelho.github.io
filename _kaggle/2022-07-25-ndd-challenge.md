After a two year hiatus from kaggle-like competitions while I focus on my PhD, happy to have won first place on [NDD Tech's](https://ndd.tech/) Machine Learning Competition! 

I developed the highest accuracy solution for classifying NF-e's ("Nota Fisacal Eletr√¥nica" - Brazil's eletronic invoice/payment system) as suspicious or not.
It was interesting to develop a solution that worked directly with the raw data instead of a already "clean" dataset - The input was the XML files which businesses report directly to the fiscal authorities and it's parsing and feature engineering challenges were directly relevant to a good solution.
