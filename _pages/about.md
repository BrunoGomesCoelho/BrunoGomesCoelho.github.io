## Photos:
The main photo used across the website is of the Institute of Computation and Mathematical Computation ([ICMC](https://www.icmc.usp.br/en/about)) of the University of SÃ£o Paulo, where I achieved my bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

The photo on this page is me enjoying the view from the Eiffel Tower.
