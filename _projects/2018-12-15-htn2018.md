# Hack The north
[Hack The north 2018](https://2018.hackthenorth.com) (HTN) is Canadas biggest hackaton - I wwas invited to attend it's 2018 event as my first international hackaton. 

I was quite nervous about leaving Brazil and going to the event - luckily for me the organizers put us in touch with people leaving from the same airport and I was quickly able to meet a fellow Brazilian, which made the whole journey extremely fun (especially considering the 8 hour layover at Mexico!).

Once there, everything was better than I could have ever imagined - the organization was great and helpful, the food was oh-so-incredibility tasty, the coffee was plentiful, the fellow hackers were very friendly, the cup stacking challenge had fierce competition ðŸ˜‰

I met so many cool and interesting people from all over the globe, made a lot of new friends and built something very cool on very little sleep with my team, overall a amazing experience!
