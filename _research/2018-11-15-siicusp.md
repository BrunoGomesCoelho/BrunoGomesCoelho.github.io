# The project
As part of [USAID's](https://www.usaid.gov/) Combating Zika and Future Threats: A Grand Challenge for Development, a research project by professor [Gustavo Batista](http://conteudo.icmc.usp.br/pessoas/gbatista/) is in development to create a smart mosquito trap, that is able to selectively capture insects based on their danger to society.

Scholarships were financed by USAID itself as part of the project.

# Research
As a research assistant, I worked closely along my professor and the rest of the team, focused on evaluating different classifiers for our given problem and pre-processing the raw data (wing beat frequency, temperature, humidity, etc) for to be used in the classifiers.

Further information of the ongoing research can be found in the various posts in this category.
