üëã Hi! Ol√°! I'm Bruno, currently a CS Ph.D. Candidate at [NYU Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/) advised by professor [Damon McCoy](http://damonmccoy.com/) working alongside the [cybersecurity for Democracy](https://cybersecurityfordemocracy.org/) group.
I work broadly in "AI for good" and their related challenging topics.

I'll be looking for Summer 2023 internships in Machine Learning and Data Science, either in North America, Europe or remote. See my resume [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link download/Bruno_Gomes_Coelho_Resume.pdf %}) and send me an [email](mailto:bruno.coelho@nyu.edu) if you think I might be a good fit!
