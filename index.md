I'm currently a Computer Science PhD student at [NYU Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/).

I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo (USP), Brazil.
There I worked in many Machine Learning projects as a Research Assistant at the Laboratory of Computational Intelligence, focusing 
primarily on DL applied to classifying insects by their wingbeat, with financing by the USAID.

During my free time I participated in many Kaggle like [competitions]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/kaggle.md %}) and co-founded [Data](http://data.icmc.usp.br/).

Before starting my PhD, I worked/consulted at various companies:
- Working on Hierarchical NLP Classification applied to e-commerce;
- Creating interactive visualizations to understand illegal wood cutting and sustainable commerce in the Amazon;
- Working with AutoML and DS tools like Driverless AI and DVC to enhance the DS developer experience at a large financial bank.

Currently I'm focusing on:
- The intersection of ML and Topology, with a focus on explainable AI, Deep Learning and Adversarial methods;
- Applying ML techniques to Esports;
- Taking part in the [Reproducibility Challenge](https://paperswithcode.com/rc2020) with friends and learning JAX;
- Mentoring students of the Data Science MBA at USP.

I am currently open to internships and consulting work in tech and can be reached through email (available in resume), with a focus on:
- Research directions understanding and applying Deep Learning;
- Prototyping and consulting on DS and Continuous Delivery for ML.

In my free time I can be often be found traveling, reading sci-fi or practicing Parkour.
