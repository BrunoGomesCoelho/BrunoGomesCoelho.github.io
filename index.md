ðŸ‘‹ Hi! OlÃ¡! I'm Bruno, currently a Computer Science PhD student at [NYU Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/) advised by professor [Damon McCoy](http://damonmccoy.com/).

I'll be looking for Summer 2023 internships in Machine Learning and Data Science, either in North America, Europe or remote. See my resume [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link download/Bruno_Gomes_Coelho_Resume.pdf %}) and send me an [email](mailto:bruno.coelho@nyu.edu) if you think I might be a good fit!

I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo (USP), with a focus in Machine Learning as a Research Assistant at the [Laboratory of Computational Intelligence](http://labic.icmc.usp.br/), while also participating in many Kaggle like [competitions]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/kaggle.md %}) and co-founding [Data](http://data.icmc.usp.br/).
