👋 Hi! Olá! I'm Bruno, currently a CS Ph.D. Candidate at [NYU Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/) advised by professor [Damon McCoy](http://damonmccoy.com/) working alongside the [Cybersecurity for Democracy](https://cybersecurityfordemocracy.org/) group.
I work broadly in applications of Machine Learning/Data Science for studying large online networks.

I'll be looking for Summer 2023 internships in Machine Learning and Data Science, either in North America, Europe or remote. See my resume [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link download/Bruno_Gomes_Coelho_Resume.pdf %}) and send me an [email](mailto:bruno.coelho@nyu.edu) if you think I might be a good fit!


focusing primarily on DL applied to classifying insects by their wingbeat, with financing by the USAID. 

Before starting my PhD, I worked/consulted at various companies:
- Working on Hierarchical NLP Classification applied to e-commerce;
- Creating interactive visualizations to understand illegal wood cutting and sustainable commerce in the Amazon;
- Working with AutoML and DS tools like Driverless AI and DVC to enhance the DS developer experience at a large financial bank.

# Background

I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the Universidade de São Paulo (USP 🇧🇷 ), with a focus in Machine Learning as a Research Assistant at the [Laboratory of Computational Intelligence](http://labic.icmc.usp.br/), while also participating in many Kaggle like [competitions]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/kaggle.md %}) 🏆 and co-founding a Machine Learning-Data Science research group ([DATA](http://data.icmc.usp.br/)).

In my free time I can be often be found traveling, reading sci-fi or practicing Parkour.
