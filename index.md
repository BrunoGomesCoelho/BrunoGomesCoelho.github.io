👋 Hi! Olá! I'm Bruno, a final year CS Ph.D. Candidate at [NYU Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/) advised by professor [Damon McCoy](http://damonmccoy.com/).org/) group.
I work broadly in applications of Machine Learning/Data Science for studying large online networks.

I recently defended my Ph.D. thesis and will be joining Kensho for my next adventure.

I'll be looking for Summer 2023 internships in Machine Learning and Data Science, either in North America, Europe or remote. See my resume [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link download/Bruno_Gomes_Coelho_Resume.pdf %}) and send me an [email](mailto:bruno.coelho@nyu.edu) if you think I might be a good fit!


focusing primarily on DL applied to classifying insects by their wingbeat, with financing by the USAID. 

Before starting my PhD, I worked/consulted at various companies:
- Working on Hierarchical NLP Classification applied to e-commerce;
- Creating interactive visualizations to understand illegal wood cutting and sustainable commerce in the Amazon;
- Working with AutoML and DS tools like Driverless AI and DVC to enhance the DS developer experience at a large financial bank.

- Working on factuality of LLM's across geographical regions


- Analysis of political ads on social media platforms
- Helping put into production some of my research into [Ad Observatory](https://adobservatory.org/)
- 🌐 Applied Multilingual NLP techniques for Topic Modeling
- 📚 Theoretical foundations of Deep Learning
- 🆕 A new research project for 2023 I'll update you about in the future ;)

As side/coding projects, I also:
- 🧑‍🏫 TA for University of São Paulo's Data Science MBA - I tutor "Introduction to Data Science", "Programming for Data Science", "Machine Learning" and "Neural Networks and Deep Learning".

- 🎄 Finishing up last years [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
- Taking the Intro to ML Safety course by the [Center for AI Safety](https://safe.ai/)
