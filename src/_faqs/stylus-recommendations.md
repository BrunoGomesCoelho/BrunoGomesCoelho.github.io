Long story short, if you have an iPad Pro do yourself a favor and get an [**Apple Pencil**][apple-pencil]. If you have an older (or non-Pro) model below are all the "dumb" styli I've had experience with.

| Stylus | Quick Impressions
|---
| [Apple Pencil][apple-pencil] | Best stylus I've used hands down. Paired with an iPad Pro it's the closest thing to drawing on paper I've experienced. |
| [Pencil by FiftyThree][pencil-stylus] | Super reliable, well designed, and long battery life. Tips have a tendency to tare quickly, but they're replaceable so its not the end of the world.
| [Ten One Design Pogo Connect][pogo-stylus] | Connectivity issues and hardware flaws were maddening to deal with. If you ignore both of those problems apps having pressure sensitive support performed well.
| [LunaTik Alloy Touch Pen][lunatik-stylus] | My trusted sidekick for a long long time. Tip (not replaceable) took some serious abuse and kept on licking. Has a refillable roller ball pen if you need a traditional writing instrument.
| [Just-Mobile AluPen][alupen-stylus] | Lasted me a few months before wearing out. Nice solid construction. Tips aren't replaceable.
| [ZEN 3 in 1][zen-stylus] | Precision disc tip dead on arrival so I couldn't test that. Rubber nib seems well made and slightly smaller than others giving a bit more precision to your draws.
| [Chalkee Series Kids Stylus][chalkee] | Good for kids with small hands. Tip isn't replaceable and wears out quickly.
| [Universal Touch Screen Pen][cheap-stylus] | Cheap, small, light, and pretty crappy. Comes in a 3 pack that are good as backup styli.

The first iPad stylus I purchased was a [Just-Mobile AluPen][alupen-stylus] and used it for quite some time before the rubber tip wore out. Following it I ended up with a [LunaTik Alloy Touch Pen][lunatik-stylus] after winning one in an [art competition](https://web.archive.org/web/20120822201917/http://lunatiklife.com/features/post/lunatikonpaper-winners).

I really like the Touch Pen because it's built to last. The tip isn't a squishy rubber nib like many others and is super durable. I've drawn close to 400 portraits with it and it works just as flawless as the day I got it. I'd still be using it if I hadn't been lured over to the dark-side of Bluetooth styli.

Speaking of Bluetooth styli, prior to Apple Pencil, [FiftyThree's Pencil][pencil-stylus] was my go to when using [**Paper**](https://fiftythree.com/paper). Before that, I was all about the [Pogo Connect Smart Pen][pogo-stylus] even though it was a piece of crap.
