If it wasn't painfully obvious, I draw, paint, and create on Apple's iPad. My current iPad is a 12.9" Pro (256GB) with the Space Gray finish. Before I took the plunge and upgraded to the larger screen I had an Air 2.

I use Apple Pencil exclusively and it's hands down the best stylus I've used on any iPad to date. Unlike many "pressure sensitive" styli before it, Apple Pencil works 100% of the time.

It doesn't disconnect, lag, or stutter while drawing or painting.

As far as protecting my iPad Pro:

- I don't use a screen protector.
- [Smart cover case](http://amzn.to/2pzUCpY).
- Glow in the dark silicone [Apple Pencil grip](http://amzn.to/2G9nT5x).
